title: CVE in @hashicorp/consul-api-double
description: >
    HashiCorp Consul 1.4.3 lacks server hostname verification for agent-to-agent TLS communication. In other words, the product behaves as if verify_server_hostname were set to false, even when it is actually set to true. This is fixed in 1.4.4.
